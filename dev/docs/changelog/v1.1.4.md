## 🎯 Overview

Version 1.1.4 is a patch release focused on improving the clarity and harmony of WebSocket interface naming conventions. This release addresses developer feedback about confusing interface names, making the Jiro.Shared library more intuitive and easier to understand for developers integrating with the ecosystem.

## ✨ Features Added

- **Clearer Interface Naming**: Renamed WebSocket interfaces to better reflect their purpose and communication direction.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Interface names now immediately convey whether they handle server-to-client or client-to-server communication.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- N/A (No user-facing bugs fixed in this release)

## 🔄 Changes

### Interface Renames
- **`IJiroClient` → `IServerToClientEvents`**: Now clearly indicates this interface handles server-to-client push events.
- **`IJiroHubClient` → `IClientToServerResponses`**: Now clearly indicates this interface handles client-to-server responses in strongly-typed hubs.
- **`IJiroSocketClient` → `IJiroClient`**: Simplified naming for the main client implementation interface.

### Documentation Updates
- Updated all XML documentation to reflect the new interface purposes.
- Enhanced region names within interfaces for better code organization.
- Improved method and event descriptions for clarity.

## 🛠️ Technical Details
